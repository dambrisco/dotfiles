## Quick start

    curl https://raw.github.com/wasbazi/dotfiles/master/get.vimfiles.sh | sh

This clones the repo, downloads all the submodules, and links the vim-related dotfiles into
the current user's home directory.  Running this command should get you up and
running with this vim config without any other work.

## Make it your own

If you want to copy this Vim config as a base for your own, you should:

* Fork this repository.
* Change the mention of "coderifous" in the get.vimfiles.sh script to your own
  github name.
* Customize the vim config to suit you.

## Highlights

### Turbo Button

This Vim config supports two runtime profiles:

* Normal, with all plugins loaded.
* Minimal, with no plugins loaded. Super fast startup!

To run Vim without loading plugins use the --noplugins option.
e.g.

    vim --noplugins

I recommend setting your EDITOR environment variable to use this option:

    export EDITOR="vim --noplugin"

This way you'll have a faster startup when other programs (e.g. git) bring up
Vim.

### vimrc Organization

This Vim config (loaded from .vimrc) is broken up across several files that are
sourced.  Each file performs a different kind of customization.  For instance
one file is responsible for customizing vim settings, while another file
is responsible for defining custom key mappings.  All plugin-related
configuration is stored in it's own file that is loaded conditionally depending
on whether the --noplugins flag was used.

### vim-bundler for plugin management

This Vim config uses the
[vim-bundler](https://github.com/vintikzzz/vim-bundler) ruby gem to manage the
plugins.  Each plugin is listed in the `vim_bundles` manifest file and is
configured to use the git submodule installation strategy.

vim-bundler relies on pathogen for load path management.

Read more about it in [vim-bundler's
README](https://github.com/vintikzzz/vim-bundler/blob/master/README.rdoc).

### Plugins

Take a look at the vim_bundles file to see all of the included plugins.

Here's a few faves:
